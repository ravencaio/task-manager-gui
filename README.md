Huge credits to Elanosinho (https://github.com/Elanosinho), the original author of this project, all functions from task_module belong to him

# Task Tracker
Task tracker project from https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker  
I've made this Task tracker with and accessible GUI using an similar library to Tkinter called Ttkbootstrap.  
It has all the functions you need, you can create, rename, update completion status and delete your tasks tasks. 

# To-do
- App theme changer
- Compile to .exe

## Usage
Install requirements; you can type ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` on your terminal to complete this step  
Run ``tasktracker.py``

## Task storage
This program uses a single JSON file to store information. Make sure to execute this application inside the ``task-tracker`` folder, as it will be less prone to errors. Also, be careful when messing directly with the ``tasks.json`` folder, becouse the app can't correct the JSON file itself
