# Task Manager
Task tracker project from https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

## Usage

Run taskmanager.py


## JSON
This program uses a single JSON file to store information. Make sure to execute this application inside the ``task-manager`` folder, as it will be less prone to errors. Also, be careful when messing directly with the ``tasks.json`` folder, as its inner content can't self-correct.
