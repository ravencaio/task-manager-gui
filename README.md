# Credits
Huge credits to Elanosinho (https://github.com/Elanosinho), the original author of this project, all functions from task_module belong to him

# Task Manager
Task tracker project from https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

# To-do
- App theme changer
- Compile to .exe

## Usage
Install requirements, you can type ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` on your terminal. Then run ``taskmanager.py``

## Task storage
This program uses a single JSON file to store information. Make sure to execute this application inside the ``task-manager`` folder, as it will be less prone to errors. Also, be careful when messing directly with the ``tasks.json`` folder, becouse the app can't correct the JSON file itself
